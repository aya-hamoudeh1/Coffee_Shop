Coffee Shop
I inspected the repository layout and the project's pubspec.yaml to compose this README. This Flutter project provides a starting point for a Coffee Shop app that uses maps, SVG assets, custom fonts, and device preview tools.

Overview
Coffee Shop is a Flutter application scaffolded with support for:

Interactive maps (flutter_map + latlong2)
SVG asset rendering (flutter_svg)
Opening external links (url_launcher)
Device preview (device_preview) for quickly testing multiple screen sizes
Custom Sora font family for a polished UI
This repo contains platform folders (android, ios, web, macos, windows, linux), an assets directory for images and fonts, and a lib directory for the app source.

Key Dependencies
Taken from pubspec.yaml:

flutter (SDK >= 3.8.1)
cupertino_icons: ^1.0.8
flutter_svg: ^2.2.1
flutter_map: ^8.2.2
latlong2: ^0.9.1
url_launcher: ^6.3.2
device_preview: ^1.3.1
Dev dependencies:

flutter_test
flutter_lints (for recommended lint rules)
Assets & Fonts
pubspec.yaml registers:

Assets:
assets/images/png/
assets/images/svg/
Fonts (Sora family):
assets/fonts/Sora/static/Sora-Thin.ttf
assets/fonts/Sora/static/Sora-ExtraLight.ttf
assets/fonts/Sora/static/Sora-Light.ttf
assets/fonts/Sora/static/Sora-Regular.ttf
assets/fonts/Sora/static/Sora-Medium.ttf
assets/fonts/Sora/static/Sora-SemiBold.ttf
assets/fonts/Sora/static/Sora-Bold.ttf
assets/fonts/Sora/static/Sora-ExtraBold.ttf
Place your images and SVGs under the listed assets directories and the Sora font files under the fonts path to ensure they are bundled.

Getting Started
Prerequisites:

Flutter SDK compatible with SDK constraint in pubspec.yaml (>= 3.8.1)
Android Studio, Xcode, or web-enabled Flutter tooling depending on target platform
Common commands:

bash
# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on a connected device (mobile)
flutter run

# Run on web (example)
flutter run -d chrome

# Run tests
flutter test

# Analyze code
flutter analyze
If you use device_preview during development, you may need to enable or disable it in main.dart as appropriate.

Project Structure
android/, ios/, web/, macos/, windows/, linux/ — platform folders generated by Flutter
